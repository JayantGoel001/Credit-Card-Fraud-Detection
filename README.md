## Fraud detection

Fraud detection is a binary classification problem in which the transactions data is analyzed and classified in “legitimate” or “fraudulent”. Credit card fraud detection techniques are classified in two general categories: fraud analysis (misuse detection) and user behavior analysis (anomaly detection)
In the first category the supervised methods are applied to classify each transaction as fraudulent or normal. The most commonly used machine learning models are Decision trees.
The second category is anomaly detection. Anomaly detection has been widely studied in statistics and machine learning. It is also known as outlier detection, deviation detection or novelty detection.
In this method the legitimate transaction are separated from fraudulent. The idea of this approach is that fraudsters behave is different than the account owner. Thus, model trained on normal transaction data should identify the anomaly. The most popular machine learning models used for anomaly detection are Autoencoders.
